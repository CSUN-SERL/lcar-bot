1) I have incoprorated all the ui files into the package.
They are located in the resource folder.

2)rqt uses a a special compiler for .ui files 
  and uses them to generate special header files. 
  The name of the header files is based the the file names.

   (eg. creates ui_gcs.h for gcs.ui)

  
   They act as sort of like "Form" files for the program.
   THey are templates for the ui that can be incorporated in qt.
   THe header files have class names that are based on the class names inside the .ui files. 

   (ex. < widget  class="Qwidget" name="MissionCancelWidget" >)

   This creates the class in the generated header file, "Forms" and its constructor.
   I then included these generated header files into "gcs.h" 
   so the gcs.cpp can use the constructor for each of the "Forms"


   To display these forms, Look at gcs.cpp anmd gcs.h for details. 
   I call the constructors for each of the UI forms. 
   I also created widget pointers for each UI that is going to be exposed
   and allocated memory to each one of them.
    I then call a function for the constructed UI forms
   that accepts the pointer to the widget as an argument

        ui_.setupUI( widget_) 
 
  this creates the ui and exposes it when you run the plugin.
