1.11.3 (2014-06-08)
-------------------
* pinhole_camera_model: fix implicit shared_ptr cast to bool for C++11
  In C++11 boost::shared_ptr does not provide the implicit bool conversion
  operator anymore, so make the cast in pinhole_camera_model.h explicit.
  That does not hurt in older C++ standards and makes compilation with C++11
  possible.

1.10.15 (2014-02-07)
--------------------
* add assignment operator for StereoCameraModel
* fixed Python rectifyImage implementation in PinholeCameraModel
* Added operator= for the PinholeCameraModel.
  Added the operator= for the PinholeCameraModel. I am not sure if the
  PinholeCameraModel needs to have a destructor, too. To follow the
  'rule of three' it should actually have one.

* Add dependency on generated messages
  Catkin requires explicit enumeration of dependencies on generated messages.
  Add this declaration to properly flatten the dependency graph and force Catkin
  to generate geometry_msgs before compiling image_geometry.

  not break when using them.
